## Stretch Goals: 
- Incorporate google maps API
- User Authentication
- Search Bar to filter listings by various values


We began with identifying our goal: to create a real estate webapp where users can create listings, view all listings, and update or delete existing listings. The planning phase included creating wireframes, user stories, and utilizing scheduling tools such as Trello to aide with the collaborative process for this project. We set goals for certain days so we would meet MVP by the deadline. We began to build the foundation of the project, the backend, while working in a virtual python environment and installed Django. Once all routes were deemed successful after a series of Postman tests, we moved onto the React frontend. Axios calls were successfully made from the React frontend to the Django API and we movde on to the design phase. We finalized a design and changed our code to be ready for launch on Render.

## Unsolved problems: 
- User Authentication - the information researched used an old version of Django, it was incompatible with our project we found out near the end, this will be revisited and improved in the future.
- Media Queries with Tailwind CSS - A few noticeable styling issues when moving sizes from a large to small screen - will be revisited in the future
